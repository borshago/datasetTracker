            "Summary:  Kidney is a vital organ responsible for homeostasis in the body. To retard kidney aging is of great importance for maintaining body health. Whereas the therapeutic strategies targeting against kidney aging are not elucidated. Recent studies show mitochondrial dysfunction is critical for renal tubular cell senescence and kidney aging, however, the underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in kidney aging have not been demonstrated. Herein, we found calcium overload, and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) was induced in renal tubular cells and aged kidney. To activate MCU not only triggered mitochondrial calcium overload, but also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cellular senescence and age-related kidney fibrosis. Inversely, to block MCU or chelate calcium diminished ROS generation, restored mitochondrial homeostasis, and retarded cell senescence and protected against kidney aging. These results demonstrate MCU plays a key role in promote renal tubular cell senescence, which provides a new insight on the therapeutic strategy for fighting against kidney aging.\n",

            "Summary:  The burden of senescent hepatocytes correlates with MASLD severity but mechanisms driving senescence, and how it exacerbates MASLD are poorly understood. Hepatocytes become senescent when Smoothened (Smo) is deleted to disrupt Hedgehog signaling. We aimed to determine if the secretomes of Smo-deficient hepatocytes perpetuate senescence to drive MASLD progression. RNA seq analysis confirmed that hepatocyte populations of MASLD livers are depleted of Smo(+) cells and enriched with senescent cells. When fed CDA-HFD, Smo(-) mice had lower antioxidant markers and developed worse DNA damage, senescence, MASH and liver fibrosis than Smo(+) mice. Sera and hepatocyte-conditioned medium from Smo(-) mice were depleted of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), a protein that maintains mitochondrial fitness. Treating Smo(-) hepatocytes with TP reduced senescence and lipotoxicity; inhibiting TP in Smo(+) hepatocytes had the opposite effects and exacerbated hepatocyte senescence, MASH, and fibrosis in CDA-HFD-fed mice.Therefore, we found that inhibiting Hedgehog signaling in hepatocytes promotes MASLD by suppressing hepatocyte production of proteins that prevent lipotoxicity and senescence.\n",

            "Summary:  microRNAs are non-coding RNAs which modulate the expression of other RNA molecules. One microRNA can target many transcripts, allowing each microRNA to play key roles in many biological pathways. miR-324 is a microRNA previously implicated in bone and cartilage maintenance, defects of which result in common age-related diseases, such as osteoporosis or osteoarthritis (OA). Cartilage damage was increased in both surgically and ageing-induced OA however changes in the cartilage transcriptome were minimal, with few miR-324 predicted targets dysregulated. However, in vivo micro-computed tomography and histology demonstrated that global miR-324-null mice had an increase in bone mineral density, trabecular thickness and cortical thickness, with many parameters increasing with age. The bones of the miR-null mice also had decreased osteocytes numbers and lipid droplets. In vivo TRAP staining revealed a decrease in osteoclasts with histomorphometry demonstrating an increased rate of bone formation in miR-324-null mice. Ex vivo assays revealed that the high bone mass phenotype of the miR-324-null mice resulted from increased osteoblast activity and decreased osteoclastogenesis. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR followed by miR-324 target prediction and validation in osteoblasts, bone marrow macrophages and osteocytes, revealed that the osteoclast fusion regulator Pin1 was a miR-324 target in the osteoclast lineage, Hoxa9 and Samd5 were osteocyte target genes and the master osteogenic regulator Runx2 was a target of miR-324-5p in osteoblasts, the in vitro overexpression of which recapitulated the increased osteogenesis and decreased adipogenesis phenotype observed in vivo. These data point to important roles of miR-324 in skeletal biology. Elucidation of pathways regulated by miR-324 offers promise for the treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis.\n",

            "Title:  Reduction in olfactory ability in aging Mitf mutant mice without evidence of neurodegeneration\n",
            "Summary:  Age-related decline occurs in most brain structures and sensory systems. An illustrative case is olfaction, where the olfactory bulb (OB) undergoes deterioration with age, resulting in reduced olfactory ability. A decline in olfaction is also associated with early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the underlying reasons are unclear. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is expressed in the projection neurons (PNs) of the OB – the mitral and tufted (M/T) cells. Primary M/T cells from Mitf mutant mice show hyperactivity, potentially attributed to reduced expression of a key potassium channel subunit, Kcnd3/Kv4.3. This influences intrinsic plasticity, an essential mechanism involving the non-synaptic regulation of neuronal activity. As neuronal hyperactivity often precedes neurodegenerative conditions, the current study aimed to determine whether the absence of Mitf has degenerative effects during aging. Aged Mitf mutant mice showed reduced olfactory ability without inflammation. However, an increase in the expression of potassium channel subunit genes in the OBs of aged Mitfmi-vga9/mi-vga9 mice suggests that during aging compensatory mechanisms lead to stabilization.\n",

            "Summary:  Aging increases breast cancer risk while an early first pregnancy reduces a woman’s life-long risk. Several studies have explored the effect of either aging or pregnancy on mammary epithelial cells (MECs), but the combined effect of both remains unclear. Here, we interrogate the functional and transcriptomic changes at single cell resolution in the mammary gland of aged nulliparous and parous mice to discover that pregnancy normalizes age-related imbalances in lineage composition, while also inducing a permanently differentiated cell state. Importantly, we uncover a minority population of Il33-expressing hybrid cells with high cellular potency that accumulate in aged nulliparous mice but is significantly reduced in aged parous mice. Functionally, IL33 treatment of basal, but not luminal, epithelial cells from young mice phenocopies aged nulliparous MECs and promotes formation of organoids with Tp53 knockdown. Collectively, our study demonstrates that pregnancy blocks the age-associated loss of lineage integrity in the basal layer through a decrease in Il33+ hybrid cells, potentially contributing to pregnancy-induced breast cancer protection.\n",

            "Title:  Dnmt3a Controls Hematopoietic Stem Cells via DNA Methylation-Independent Regulation of Telomeres\n",
            "Summary:  Dnmt3a is the most recurrently mutated gene in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and it is a critical regulator of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Conditional deletion of Dnmt3a in mouse HSC results in enhanced self-renewal but impaired differnetiation. Dnmt3a encodes for a de novo DNA methyltransferase enzyme but both mouse and human cells with loss of Dnmt3a show minimal change in DNA methylation levels which do not correlate with gene expression differences. To understand if these changes are due to non-canonical function of Dnmt3a, we generated varying levels of DNA methyaltion-impared Dnmt3a mouse models. Our data depicts that DNA methyaltion-impaired Dnmt3a phenocopy wild-type in serial transplant. And Dnmt3a methyltransferase-deficient HSCs showed differntially methylated regions (DMRs) and gene expression pattern that overlapped with Dnmt3a-null HScs. Suggesting that Dnmt3a has important non-canonical function that partially regulates HSC fate. Dnmt3a-null HSC increased HSC self-renwal and can be transplanted indefinitely and increase longevity with no erosion of telomere length. Dnmt3a-null HSCs showed increased telomere at baseline and maintained overa serial transplant and increased telomerase activity. The role of Dnmt3a in telomere maintenance was not strictly linked to elongated telomere length but in regulation of DNA damage response that occurs at stressed telomeres. These data show a unidentified role of Dnmt3a in HSC telomere maintenance that is note related to DNA methylation function.\n",

            "Title:  Brain-Derived CCN3 Is An Osteoanabolic Hormone That Sustains Bone in Lactating Females [ARC]\n",
            "Summary:  During lactation, mothers initiate cycles of bone formation followed by significant bone loss to meet the high calcium (Ca2+) demand by progeny. While estrogen functions typically as an anabolic driver of bone remodeling, this sex steroid is absent in postpartum females. Here, we report that a brain-derived secreted from neurons of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) fills this void and functions as a potent osteogenic factor to promote bone mass in lactating females. We previously reported an extraordinarily sex-specific high bone mass phenotype in female mice that persists with aging and is central in origin after eliminating estrogen receptor alpha signaling in ARCKISS1 neurons. Parabiosis and bone transplant studies established that a humoral factor in mutant females accounts for this unusual skeletal phenotype. High bone mass in mutant females could be traced back to the skeletal stem cell (SSC) level, reflected by their increased frequency and osteochondrogenic potential. Based on ex-vivo, in vivo, and in vitro assays, one protein emerged as the most promising secreted pro-osteogenic factor from the ARC, acting in mice and human SSCs at low concentrations (<nM) independent of age and sex. The role of this brain-derived factor in bone formation was confirmed by in vivo gain and loss of function studies. Unexpectedly, in wild-type females, a transient spike of this protein appears in ARCKISS1 neurons coincident with lactation when bone remodeling and high calcium demand intensify in estrogen-depleted mothers. Our findings establish a potentially new therapeutic anabolic bone hormone that functions in a novel female-specific brain-bone axis to ensure mammalian species survival.\n",
